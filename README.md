## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To get Nuti up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JihyeAnnaOh/nuti.git
cd nuti
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Nuti requires several API keys to function. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add the following:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
